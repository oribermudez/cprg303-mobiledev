### Context:

The team has been assigned the task of developing a mobile app for a modern transportation company. The app's primary purpose is to enable users to book and track rides, access driver details, view ride history, and make secure payments. To accomplish these tasks effectively, several key requirements have been outlined for the app development process.

### Problem Statement ü§î

The team must carefully choose a geolocation service provider (e.g., Google Maps or Mapbox) based on factors like accuracy, coverage, and cost to enable ride booking and tracking.

##### Options Considered üîÅ

- Google Maps
- Mapbox

##### Decision ‚≠ê

- Google Maps

##### Rationale üí°

In selecting the geolocation service for our ride booking and tracking platform, the team carefully evaluated two prominent options: Google Maps and Mapbox. After a thorough consideration of factors such as accuracy, coverage, and overall cost, the decision was made to opt for Google Maps. Google Maps was chosen due to its established brand reputation, extensive experience, and longstanding presence in the market. Its well-established track record translated to a quicker implementation process, providing a valuable advantage for our project [1].

One of the critical features that distinguished Google Maps was its ability to offer real-time traffic updates, a vital aspect for our product that significantly enhances the user experience [1]. Additionally, Google Maps provided us with comprehensive documentation and robust customer support, ensuring a smooth development process and reliable assistance throughout the project [1]. These factors collectively made Google Maps the optimal choice for our geolocation service, aligning with our project's objectives and requirements.
