## Authentication and Authorization 🔎

### Context:

The team has been assigned the task of developing a mobile app for a modern transportation company. The app's primary purpose is to enable users to book and track rides, access driver details, view ride history, and make secure payments. To accomplish these tasks effectively, several key requirements have been outlined for the app development process.

### Problem Statement 🤔

Implementing a secure authentication and authorization system for both drivers and passengers is vital. Decisions regarding authentication mechanisms (e.g., email/password, social login) and enforcing proper authorization rules must be made.

##### Options Considered 🔁

- Auth0
- OneLogin

##### Decision ⭐

- Auth0

##### Rationale 💡

The decision to choose Auth0 as the preferred Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform for our transportation mobile app, Route Rider, was based on a thorough analysis of available options and alignment with our specific requirements. Auth0 offers a developer-friendly approach[1], providing a versatile toolkit for authentication and authorization. Its extensive support for diverse identity needs and scalability are essential features that align well with the critical need to secure user identities and manage access effectively within our transportation app. Furthermore, Auth0's branding customization options allow us to maintain a consistent user experience while ensuring the highest levels of security [1]. Although we anticipate potential cost considerations as user numbers grow, Auth0's strengths in integration flexibility and scalability make it the optimal choice to meet our current and future needs securely and efficiently.

This decision was informed by a comparative analysis of Auth0 and OneLogin in Identity and Access Management (IAM) by J. Flower [1]. The analysis provided valuable insights into the capabilities and benefits of both platforms, ultimately confirming Auth0 as the superior choice for our specific use case. By leveraging Auth0's robust authentication and authorization features, we are confident in our ability to provide a secure and seamless user experience for both drivers and passengers within our transportation app, Route Rider.
